"""
create_images.py

This script generates realistic real estate images for property listings using OpenAI's GPT and DALL-E models.
It reads property data from a JSON file, creates vivid image prompts with GPT, generates images via DALL-E,
saves the images locally, and updates the dataset with image paths.

Usage:
    python create_images.py

Dependencies:
    - openai
    - langchain_community
    - scikit-image
    - data/data.json (input dataset)
